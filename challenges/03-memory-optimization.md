# Challenge 3: Memory Matters

## The Situation
The analysis system is experiencing high memory usage, particularly when generating analysis results for multiple tanks. The excessive memory allocation is causing performance issues and potential out-of-memory risks.

## Technical Issue
The `get_analysis_result` function in the aqua-brain service (in `src/challenges.rs`) is creating unnecessary String objects for every analysis result, leading to excessive memory allocation and duplication.

## Your Task
Optimize the memory usage in the `get_analysis_result` function by reducing dynamic String allocations. This can be achieved through static string references or string interning techniques.

## Hints
1. Look for unnecessary String allocations (especially repetitive .to_string() calls)
2. Consider using string literals (&str) for static text
3. For a more advanced solution, look into string interning to deduplicate repeated strings
4. The internment crate is available if you choose the interning approach

## Testing Your Solution
After implementing your fix:
1. Significantly reduce the number of .to_string() calls
2. Either use static references (&str) or implement string interning
3. Verify that the analysis results are still correct
4. Monitor memory usage improvement

## Learning Outcomes
This challenge teaches memory optimization in Rust applications:
- Understanding String vs &str trade-offs
- Using static string references efficiently
- Learning about string interning for memory deduplication
- Identifying and eliminating unnecessary allocations

Good luck! Every byte counts when analyzing thousands of tank parameters.
