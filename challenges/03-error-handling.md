# Challenge 3: Memory Matters

## The Situation
The analysis system is experiencing high memory usage, particularly when generating analysis results for multiple tanks. The excessive memory allocation is causing performance issues and potential out-of-memory risks.

## Technical Issue
The `get_analysis_result` function in the aqua-brain service (in `src/challenges.rs`) is creating unnecessary String objects for every analysis result, leading to excessive memory allocation.

## Your Task
Optimize the memory usage in the `get_analysis_result` function by using static string references instead of creating new String objects.

## Hints
1. Look for unnecessary String allocations
2. Consider using string literals (&str) for static text
3. Identify opportunities to reuse static strings
4. Pay attention to where .to_string() is being used

## Testing Your Solution
After implementing your fix:
1. Replace String allocations with static references where possible
2. Use const declarations for frequently used strings
3. Verify that the analysis results are still correct
4. Monitor memory usage improvement

## Learning Outcomes
This challenge teaches memory optimization in Rust applications:
- Understanding String vs &str trade-offs
- Using static string references efficiently
- Identifying and eliminating unnecessary allocations
- Implementing memory-efficient data structures

Good luck! Every byte counts when analyzing thousands of tank parameters.
